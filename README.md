# MyerSplashAndroid
MyerSplash for Android. Just for fun, and will not be published since there are so many amazing Unsplash apps on Android.

MyerSplash for Windows is open-source too. Visit it [here](https://github.com/JuniperPhoton/MyerSplash).

The project is built under **Retrofit** + **RxJava** + **ButterKnife** and so on. Feel free to communicate.
